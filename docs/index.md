# Theta Screener – Reference Documentation

Theta Screener is a **reference MVP** that demonstrates how to consume **ThetaSwap public market data endpoints** and present them in a token discovery and analytics dashboard.

This application runs in **read-only mode**. Wallet connection and swap execution are intentionally delegated to **ThetaSwap** via an external redirect.

These docs are **unofficial and observational**, created by reviewing the Theta Screener codebase to help developers understand the current MVP scope, limitations, and extension points.
